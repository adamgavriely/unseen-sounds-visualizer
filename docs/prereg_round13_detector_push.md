# Round 13: 12-hour detector push (28–29 Sept 2026) — protocol fixed before any new DEV number

*Written 2026-09-28 at the start of the block, before any round-13 idea was run on any clip. Adam: "for the next 12h
you will only try to improve the sounds recognition (decrease needed dropped or increase unheard and so on); consult
with Fable about ideas and suggest yourself and try them."*

## Goal
More needed sounds heard and shown (hits), without more wrong pictures than the hits are worth
(viewer cost = 4 × miss + 2 × wrong, per clip, `benchmark/gold/score_per_sound.py`).

## Baseline
**B0 = the scored config (PANNs veto 0.05)**, i.e. the config the frozen TEST table was scored with and the better arm on
DEV (`docs/dev_candidates_check_2026-09-28.md`: 14 hits, 24 wrong, cost 2.78). Every round-13 candidate is built on top
of B0, so a TEST comparison is not confounded by the veto swap. B1 (self-veto, current `use_shipped()`) is reported
beside. Whether `use_shipped()` returns to the PANNs veto is Adam's decision (TODO), not part of this round.

## Status of the data
- **DEV (49 clips, 36 needed sounds) is spent as a confirmation set.** In this round it is the DEVELOPMENT set: every DEV
  number is exploratory; ideas may be tuned on it.
- **AudioSet (280 / 415 / fresh)** may be used only as a component screen (e.g. does a verifier separate the 61 band
  events), never as a decision.
- **TEST: exactly ONE exposure, at the end of the block, of exactly ONE candidate** (or none), picked by the DEV rule
  below. No second TEST run of any variant. No slice-B clip is read.

## DEV selection rule (to pick the one TEST candidate)
Among round-13 candidates, full pipeline on DEV (stage 4 → gate → shipped display rules, ours re-run in the same job):
eligible iff hits ≥ B0 hits + 1 AND wrong ≤ B0 wrong + 2 × (hits gained) AND cost < B0 cost. Pick the lowest DEV cost;
ties → fewer wrong. If none is eligible, TEST is not touched and the round reports "no candidate".

## TEST decision (one exposure)
Candidate vs B0 re-run in the same job on the TEST split, same scorer, paired clip bootstrap 2000 (seed 0).
**Better** iff hits do not drop AND wrong does not rise by more than 2 × hits gained AND Δ cost < 0 with one-sided
p < 0.05. **Worse** iff Δ cost > 0 with lower 95 % bound > 0 or the hits/wrong rule fails. Otherwise **same**.
Reported always next to B0 and B1: heard by stage 4, hits, misses, wrong (visible / cross / phantom), cost.
Only "better" ships (behind a flag, turned on in `use_shipped()`); the frozen TEST table stays as scored and the new row
is added beside it with this disclosure.

## Log
Every idea tried in this block is listed below with its DEV row (kept even when it fails), so the number of looks at DEV
is on record.

### 2026-09-28/29 — rules R13-1, R13-2, R13-5, R13-6 (Fable consult), DEV, job 31340247 (H200, 20 min)
**What.** Each rule is in the pipeline source behind its own flag in `config.py`, default OFF: `TWIN_MAX` (R13-1),
`MIRROR_VETO` b + `MIRROR_OWN_MAX` 0.4 (R13-2), `IMPULSE_MIN_SPAN` 0.2 + `IMPULSE_FAMILIES` (R13-5), `RETRIGGER`
(1.5 s, FlexSED 0.4, BEATs 0.175) + `RETRIGGER_RAW` (R13-6). Stage 4's union/veto block is now one function,
`fuse_flexsed` (`src/stage4_audio_event_detection/__init__.py`), called by `detect_events` and by the harness
`benchmark/gold/round13_dev.py` on the cached scores, so each arm runs the pipeline's own code. R13-6 records per-family
"breaks" on `AudioEvent`/`AugmentationSpec` (`breaks` field); `merge_by_label` and `_display_spans` never join two bursts
across one (`src/labels.py`, `src/stage6_visual_augmentation/__init__.py`; `score_per_sound.load_pictures` passes it).
Every arm = B0's stage-4 env set explicitly (FLEXSED_BAR 0.8, FLEXSED_VETO 0.3, PANNS_VETO 0.05, BEATS_SELF_VETO 0, MONO,
no cap) + its flags; stage 5 as `dev_candidates_check` (scored gate answers reused, other questions memoised).
**Gates.** Flags off: D0 98/98 (extract, flexsed_raw, union, veto vs the scored trace, PANNs veto recomputed with CNN14),
label/start/end/conf/origin equal to devcand B0r 98/98, **D5 49/49 both systems** (B0r = the scored render).
**Facts found before the run.**
- R13-1 makes 39 absorbed sub-display BEATs spans displayable (every FlexSED twin is >= 0.8 by construction).
- R13-5: FlexSED has queries only for Gunshot, Gasp, Hammer, Explosion, Knock (none for Whack, Clang, Slam, Bang). At
  FlexSED's 0.8 bar none of the four (b)-bucket misses (0.42–0.76) can pass; the rule adds one Gasp span on DEV
  (`b3_ia_youtube_skxtz9foauw_0` 22.44 s), which does not become a picture.
- R13-6: a single stage-4 span cannot hold a 1.5-s evidence gap (BEATs column >= 0.175 throughout, FlexSED >= 0.8, twin
  tolerance 1 s), so the rule can act only where the display merge bridges 1.5–2.0 s. The ambulance Vehicle 0–14.75 s is
  one BEATs run: not splittable. **The Crowd case is not a merge of two families.** Trace of `ly_applause_62ZYD0u`: BEATs
  Applause 6.0–7.75; FlexSED Crowd 0–1.04 and 1.12–11.12; canonical(Applause) = Crowd, so the twin rule pulled Applause to
  1.12 and `consolidate_families` chained the FlexSED-only Crowd 0–1.04 into it (gap 0.08 s) → one Crowd picture at 0.0.
  Minimal fix implemented (`RETRIGGER_RAW`): a later firing of a different sound (not same label / ancestor /
  descendant) is not chained, and the boundary is a break. No detector puts an onset in the hit window [1.4, 2.9] s
  (FlexSED Crowd >= 0.4 runs 13 s from 0.0), so no merge fix can make this a hit. R13-6ev = the evidence rule alone.

Pipeline without gate (heard / hits / wrong / cost / Δ vs B0r): B0r 17/17/50/3.59; B1 16/16/56/3.92; R13-1 18/18/53/3.63
(+0.04 [−0.20, +0.24]); R13-2b08 16/16/46/3.51; R13-2b07 16/16/42/3.35 (−0.24 [−0.53, −0.04]); R13-5 = B0r; R13-6
17/17/52/3.67; R13-6ev = B0r; STACK12b08 17/17/50/3.59; STACK12b07 17/17/46/3.43 (−0.16 [−0.53, +0.12]); STACK1256b08
17/17/52/3.67; STACK1256b07 17/17/48/3.51.

**Best b = 0.7** (R13-2b07 cost 2.69 vs b 0.8 2.78), so **STACK12 = STACK12b07, STACK1256 = STACK1256b07**; the b 0.8
stacks are kept above as run. **Reading.** Only **R13-1** passes the DEV selection rule (+1 hit, Cricket; wrong 24 → 24:
the late Cricket cross picture goes, a Train cross picture in `bell_miami` comes; cost 2.78 → 2.69, Δ −0.08 [−0.37,
+0.12]). R13-2 removes the laundromat Vehicle phantoms (all three at b 0.7) and two cross pictures, but also drops the
needed Glass hit in `mv_protest_scene_movie` (BEATs Shatter/Glass where FlexSED's top query is another family), so hits
fall; at b 0.7 two laundromat Train phantoms appear in place of the Vehicle ones. STACK12b07 has the lowest cost (2.61,
Δ −0.16 [−0.49, +0.08]) but is not eligible: hits stay 14 (Cricket gained, Glass lost). R13-5 and R13-6ev change no
picture; R13-6 is worse by one cross picture (the Crowd split, as predicted). No CI excludes 0.
Files: `benchmark/gold/round13_dev.py`, `benchmark/gold/round13_dev.json`, `slurm/job_round13.sh`, `data/work/r13/`.
On the cluster the round-13 source is only in `~/MscProj_r13` (data/ and ckpts/ link to `~/MscProj`): `~/MscProj` was
not touched because the listener job 31334159 was running; the 9 changed files must be synced into `~/MscProj` after it ends.
R13-6 did not add a general "never merge two families" rule: the only cross-family merge in the pipeline is `_dedup`'s
depiction-similarity merge, left unchanged.
