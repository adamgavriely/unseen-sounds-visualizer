# Round 13: 12-hour detector push (28–29 Sept 2026) — protocol fixed before any new DEV number

*Written 2026-09-28 at the start of the block, before any round-13 idea was run on any clip. Adam: "for the next 12h
you will only try to improve the sounds recognition (decrease needed dropped or increase unheard and so on); consult
with Fable about ideas and suggest yourself and try them."*

## Goal
More needed sounds heard and shown (hits), without more wrong pictures than the hits are worth
(viewer cost = 4 × miss + 2 × wrong, per clip, `benchmark/gold/score_per_sound.py`).

## Baseline
**B0 = the scored config (PANNs veto 0.05)**, i.e. the config the frozen TEST table was scored with and the better arm on
DEV (`docs/dev_candidates_check_2026-09-28.md`: 14 hits, 24 wrong, cost 2.78). Every round-13 candidate is built on top
of B0, so a TEST comparison is not confounded by the veto swap. B1 (self-veto, current `use_shipped()`) is reported
beside. Whether `use_shipped()` returns to the PANNs veto is Adam's decision (TODO), not part of this round.

## Status of the data
- **DEV (49 clips, 36 needed sounds) is spent as a confirmation set.** In this round it is the DEVELOPMENT set: every DEV
  number is exploratory; ideas may be tuned on it.
- **AudioSet (280 / 415 / fresh)** may be used only as a component screen (e.g. does a verifier separate the 61 band
  events), never as a decision.
- **TEST: exactly ONE exposure, at the end of the block, of exactly ONE candidate** (or none), picked by the DEV rule
  below. No second TEST run of any variant. No slice-B clip is read.

## DEV selection rule (to pick the one TEST candidate)
Among round-13 candidates, full pipeline on DEV (stage 4 → gate → shipped display rules, ours re-run in the same job):
eligible iff hits ≥ B0 hits + 1 AND wrong ≤ B0 wrong + 2 × (hits gained) AND cost < B0 cost. Pick the lowest DEV cost;
ties → fewer wrong. If none is eligible, TEST is not touched and the round reports "no candidate".

## TEST decision (one exposure)
Candidate vs B0 re-run in the same job on the TEST split, same scorer, paired clip bootstrap 2000 (seed 0).
**Better** iff hits do not drop AND wrong does not rise by more than 2 × hits gained AND Δ cost < 0 with one-sided
p < 0.05. **Worse** iff Δ cost > 0 with lower 95 % bound > 0 or the hits/wrong rule fails. Otherwise **same**.
Reported always next to B0 and B1: heard by stage 4, hits, misses, wrong (visible / cross / phantom), cost.
Only "better" ships (behind a flag, turned on in `use_shipped()`); the frozen TEST table stays as scored and the new row
is added beside it with this disclosure.

## Log
Every idea tried in this block is listed below with its DEV row (kept even when it fails), so the number of looks at DEV
is on record.
